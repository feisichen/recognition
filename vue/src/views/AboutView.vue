    RCUDA Todo List

    <item status="done">
      tests/doubleFloat.R - failing with the floats. Getting the wrong answer.
      Need .numericAsDouble to cover all parameters, not just the numeric ones.
      So needed one for the length(x) as well as the x and out.

      cuDeviceGetAttribute -
      CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPUTE_MODE returns an enum. We need to map it to the R name-value pair.
      <item>
        cuDeviceGetAttribute - put the name of the attibute queried on the result.
        Unfortunately, it is auto created so we'd have to intercede there, i.e., using typeMap
        or hardcoding how to convert these types of requests in cuda.createNativeProxy().
      </item>
      <item>
        Set the default device to 1 for cuDeviceGetName() and others like it.
      </item>
      <item>
        Make the names of the functions consistent
        getDeviceProperties versus cuDeviceGetAttributes.
        getDeviceProperties uses a deprecated function, so just kill off.
        Different choices for approach.

        R_cuModuleGetFunction doesn't seem to return the function.
        Instead it seems to expect a CUfunction pointer when this is probably the return value.
        The function isOutPointerType is the culprit and we explicitly identify pointers to CUfunction as not out arguments in
        that function! (See the return() expression.)
        <br/>
        What routines have a parameter that is a pointer to a CUfunction?
        <r:code>
          rc = r [ grep("/cuda/", sapply(r, getFileName)) ]
        </r:code>
        <r:code><![CDATA[
          isCUfunction = function(ty) isPointerType(ty) && getName(getPointeeType(ty)) == "CUfunction"
          i = sapply(rc, function(f) any(sapply(f@params, function(cur) isCUfunction(getType(cur)))))
          ]]></r:code>
        So only one!  The other routines take a CUfunction value, not a pointer to one. So this is an out argument.
        <br/>
        If we remove the CUfunction from the vector of special names,
        <r:expr>cuda.createNativeProxy(rc$cuModuleGetFunction)</r:expr>
        almost behaves. The CUfunction is allocated on the stack. Is this okay?
        <br/>
        But what about the other routines.
        <r:code>
          isCUfunction = function(ty) getName(ty) == "CUfunction"
          i = sapply(rc, function(f) any(sapply(f@params, function(cur) isCUfunction(getType(cur)))))
          lapply(rc[i], cuda.createNativeProxy)
        </r:code>
        <br/>
        A CUfunction is already a pointer to a CUfunc_st. But this is irrelevant.

        Finish off generating the documents for the functions and classes (enums) not documented.

        seg faulting when quitting out of R, at least on lipschitz.
        <br/>
        Could it be the version of gcc, R, etc. No, looks like CUDA library issue.
        <br/>
        If we allocate memory, we don't get the segfault.
        So I've added a C routine we call in .onLoad()
        to create the context and allocate a byte.
        <br/>
        Looks like a clean up issue in libcuruntime.
        Similar issue in pycuda but with libcudarand.

        Problem when checking tag on a reference.
        Specifically void and voidPtr.
        See inst/doc/distPitch.R.
        <r:code>
          library(RCUDA)
          m = matrix(as.numeric(1:20), 5, 4)
          mem = cudaMallocPitch(ncol(m) * 4L, nrow(m))
          ref = convertToPtr(t(m), "float")

          cudaMemcpy2D(mem[[1]], mem[[2]], ref, ncol(m)*4L, ncol(m)*4L, nrow(m), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice)
          cudaMemcpy2D(ref, mem[[2]], mem[[1]], ncol(m)*4L, ncol(m)*4L, nrow(m), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost)
        </r:code>
        <br/>
        We can disable this test on the tag but it would be better  to get it right and consistent, not a special case
        or string comparisons on the tag.
      </item>

      <item status="done">
        cudaMemcpy2D should coerce to a voidPtr, not a void.

        RCUDA:::cudaMemcpy2D(mem[[1]], mem[[2]], t(AB), nrow(AB)*4L, nrow(AB)*4L, ncol(AB), RCUDA:::cudaMemcpyHostToDevice)
        <br/>
        Fails trying to coerce the matrix to a voidPtr.
        Should this be a void. But still no method to coerce R object to void.

        cudaMemcpy2D should raise an error if the C routine doesn't return 0.
        The C routine returns an object of class cudaError_t.
        This is different CUresult.
        So we have to generate the code differently to understand which
        error type it is getting.

        Make the code that expects a device number consistently us as(, "CUDeviceNum") or as (, "CUdevice").
        Auto-generated code such as cudaDeviceGetPCIBusId causes problems as the declaration is integer.
        Also, cuDeviceGet() gets back the correct number but then calls as(num, "CUdevice") which decrements
        the value so it is wrong. When we get back from C code, we should leave it as is.
        So new("CUdevice", value) or have the C code do it.
        When the device is an argument, then do the subtraction.

        <item status="check">
          integer to CUdevice should subtract 1.
          And when reutrn a CUdevice, put a class on it
          so that we keep it as is when we pass it to an
          R function/C routine.
          Put this in the typeMap.
